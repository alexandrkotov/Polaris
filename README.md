## SHOWCASE FOR POLARIS

#### Task

The test on the remote device needs to record some type of data to an output file during the testâ€™s execution on the remote device and write the output to a json or yaml file.

Once the data is written to the output file, return the data to the local device via a programmatic method.

#### Solution

##### *Prerequisite*

- [ ] The remote device is Ubuntu 64-bit on VMware Workstation 16 Player
- [ ] Username and password are used only, no public key.

##### *Process description*

The script `main_polaris.py` establishes  ssh connection to the remote device, creates a remote folder if it doesn't exist, copies the script `remote_script.py` into the remote folder, runs the remote script and gets the result that is generated by the remote script to the local folder.
